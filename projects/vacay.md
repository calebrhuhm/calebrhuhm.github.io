One of my other biggest achievements is practing taekwondo to achieve a black belt.  Couple of things here: it is fair to say that something I achieved when I was 13 CANNOT be one of my biggest projects.  Oh wait, except it is!  Secondly, I have suffered serious leg injuries due to a long fall, and can no longer practice taekwondo.  However, the lessons I learned and the focus on the body and exercise will stay with me forever.
It takes about 3 months to achieve a "rank-up," or get the next belt.  There are 14 belts or something.  Overall, I would say the process took 3 years.
I would like to mention that I also was able to run a 400 meter in 56 seconds in the 8th grade and won first place in the DISTRICT in the Discus.  These may be early achievements, but they are significant to me.  I also enjoyed wrestling, but now, watching sports is good enough for me.
