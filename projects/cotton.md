The Hawaiian Humane Society is located on King street, which is not far from UH Manoa.  I am proud to say I have worked there for over a year.  I have never actually held a job previously longer than 4 months.
My job is taking large (50 lb.) bags of dog food and packing them into 5-pound bags for whoever comes in.  Anyone is eligible, as long as they legitimately have pets.  We also give out leashes, collars, toys, treats, pet carriers, and lots of other stuff.
Carrying 50 pound crates full of dog food and cat food can be very strenuous.  We use carts to help us.  We follow all guidelines to make sure the food is properly stored.  We do not always have specific foods that customers like, because our food is donation-based.
