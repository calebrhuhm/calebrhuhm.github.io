#Software Engineering Goals
	Like most University of Hawaii computer science students, my immediate goal is to earn a bachelors degree.  This is such a dream for me, I cannot even imagine what the next steps would be after that.  I am taking my time with my education, and although I already have my associate’s degree, I do not plan to graduate UH for 3-4 more years.  I find that I am more successful when I take a more manageable courseload.  But eventually, I hope to find a job in the computers field.
	While my favorite part of computer science is the programming itself, and frankly, I am less comfortable handling other computer-related tasks, I am also understanding that these skills are becoming obsolete due to A.I..  So, I think a job in a computers-related field such as Database Management could be good.  One thing I wanted to do was pursue a double major in Physics.  I would like to add right here that if nothing else, I would certainly love teaching computer science, say, at the community college level.
	The good thing is that so far my computer science education has went on the right track, and I am very fortunate it is going so well.  I understand that sometimes things don’t always work out, so I will always have back up plans if my education doesn’t work out.  I would hope to not only keep learning more things to do with the languages I already know but also learn several new languages so I can be competitive as a programmer.
	I need to work a lot harder on developing all computer-related skills necessary for this class besides programming.  For instance, I found the professional portfolio assignment extremely difficult, when really there is nothing undoable there.  I would like to keep being allowed to used ChatGPT throughout my University of Hawaii computer science experience but also be able to do everything that’s asked of me without relying on it.
