Asking Smart Questions

	In the world of computer science, you will need to ask a lot of questions.  It is important to understand the difference between a smart question and a not smart question.  If you don't do what is required on your end to make an inquiry more fair and productive, it will most likely be completely disregarded.
	One thing you can do to avoid asking a question at all is to search the archives on StackOverflow or another message board.  Ask a close friend. It can be helpful to include, "I have already tried Googling this", so other readers won't feel they have to do the same thing.  Include some of the codes you may have tried, to give readers a vantage point.
	It is important that your questions are in the correct forum.  Avoid cross-posting.  The header of your post is very important; it should be specific and straightforward enough.  Avoiding making any guesses about what you think the problem might be; describe the stages of the problem as they appear.
	When including code, give specific indicators of what line of code contains the problem.  Note that there are hackers all over the internet wiling to supply you with dangerous code.  When a solution has been reached, it can be courteous to follow up.
	For a good example, look at this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78967168/how-to-avoid-that-a-c-builder-android-application-quits-when-camera-in-use-ico This is a solid question.  A developer can completely understand the user's problem simply by reading the title.  The symptoms are clearly described in order, as a process.  The question does not include any code snippets or attempts, but this is unnecessary because it is more of an operating-system-related problem the user is describing rather than a coding problem.  There is enough description in the post to validate a good answer.  This is not a "bad" question.
	For a bad example, look at this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78967162/git-push-sparse-repository This is undoubtedly not as intelligent of a question.  The title is completely unclear.  Even though they describe the problem well and shows some attempts they have made, one must suspect that the user has not done enough Googling, checking with Artificial Intelligence, or simply asking somebody.  This question is far too easy to be posted on StackOverflow.
	Hopefully these examples help somewhat to illustrate the difference between a smart question and one that is not so smart.  StackOverflow should not ever be your first resort, as there are countless other resources.  However, using StackOverflow correctly can be beneficial and is a valid way to learn.
