#All-in-one UH Counseling page
#Overview
The Academic Advising services at UH can be a very strenuous process.  There should be some changes to STAR Balance to make it a more complete all-in-one system for scheduling and following up with counseling appointments and also hearing about the mandatory ones ahead of time all in one place.  This would be a page similar to Balance to fulfill that need.
#Approach
There would be a calendar page that would send you reminders whenever you had an upcoming mandatory advising and would offer you simple buttons to RSVP for virtual appointments oor schedule in person appointments.  There would also be an option for non-mandatory appointments, very similar to what is on there now
#Mockup Page ideas
The mockup page would just be a copy of STAR balance with some features added.  It would be inspired by the Balance page but some changes would be made so it includes all the new features.
