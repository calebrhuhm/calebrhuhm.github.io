Using U.I. Frameworks

  As part of the natural process of learning more about programming languages and the end result of a finished product, (and more specifically, focusing so much on HTML and CSS!) we have realized that one needs to use certain frameworks in the process of code creation.  A perfect example of this is Bootstrap 5.  Using a framework like Bootstrap involves loading certain files into an HTML document, and then writing your code much differently than you would have otherwise written it without the framework.  In my own amateur opinion, once you have loaded a framework like Bootstrap into your code, the process of coding after that is more like a code within a code.  None of the code you write for Bootstrap compiles the same way with regular HTML.
  Overall, I find using a framework like Bootstrap to be useful because it gives you a certain structure in your code that you find is completely necessary.  For example, it has an entirely different process of breaking the webpage (or whatever you're working on) down into Header, main, and footer, etc.  You are able to use a lot of tags to make certain modifications that would otherwise require a much longer bit of CSS.  Bootstrap is also somewhat similar to HTML in that a lot of the CSS modifications you do with Bootstrap also work with regular HTML.  So I see using a framework like Bootstrap as a completely positive thing.
  Here is an image of a webpage I created using Bootstrap.  It is designed to be a mockup of the Murphy's Bar & Grill website

  Please note!  This was an in-class PRACTICE WOD, and I resized the logo before finishing it!  I added the horizontal bars on the footer...all that good stuff.
  This shows how efficient Bootstrap is at creating a mockup of many common websites; this took less than 30 minutes.  There were really no major issues using Bootstrap as opposed to a normal HTML framework, as I've said, simple changes like Header, Footer, and Main can be extremely helpful.  I hope I have gotten across that I like using Bootstrap, as I now have made several mockup websites and a few of my own.  THANK YOU!
